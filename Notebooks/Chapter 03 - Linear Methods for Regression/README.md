# Linear Methods for Regression

In this chapter, I have implemented some linear regression methods from scratch:

   * Linear Least Squares Regression
   * Multiple Regression from Simple Univariate Regression:
      * Regression by Successive Orthogonalization (Standard Gram-Schmidt)
      * Regression by Successive Orthogonalization (QR-Factorization)
   * Subset Selection:
      * Best-Subset Selection
      * Forward-Stepwise Selection
      * Backward-Stepwise Selection
   * Shrinkage Methods:
      * Ridge Regression
      * The Lasso
      * Least-Angle Regression
   * Derived Input Methods:
      * Principal Components Regression
      * Partial Least Squares
   * Related Path Algorithms:
      * Incremental Forward Stagewise Regression

I have also included some mathematical derivations, proofs and explanations of some of the algorithms.

There are two sections (3.4.3 and 3.6) about the discussions about some of the methods, which are supported with visualizations.

I strive to reproduce the tables and plots to be as close/identical as possible with the ones in the book, including the the formatting and styling.
