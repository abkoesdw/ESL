# Elements of Statistical Learning Python Codes

This repo contains implementations of algorithms presented in the [https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/](Elements of Statistical Learning Book) by Friedman et. al.

This was originally from my notes and previous codes when I took the Statistical Learning course in University of Waterloo. The codes already exist in my personal computer. Here, I'm just trying to put them together in one repo.
